#
#  X10mqtt gateway
#
#   This script allows for bridging between MQTT and X10.
#
#   It utilizes the 'heyu' command (https://www.heyu.org) for X10 control
#   and monitoring.
#
#   This was written and tested using a CM11a attached via a USB-to-Serial
#   adapter.  It may work with a CM17 Firecracker as well.
#
#   This does NOT support the USB devices like the SmartHome PowerLinc 1132B,
#   or the X10 CM15A.
#
#   This only allows ON and OFF commands to X10 appliance modules (or lamp modules).
#   Sorry, dimmer control is NOT supported.
